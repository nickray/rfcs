An experimental repository for collecting SoloKeys RFCs. SoloKeys RFCs
are proposals to extend or modify SoloKeys functionality. They are meant
to gather feedback and collect constraints, as well as to bikeshed
various API options.

### Warning: Not really open for business

**The text below is preliminary.** We've not really done any RFCs yet
and we don't quite know what process we want. The idea is to start off
with a few "seed RFCs" and gain experience before we start fielding
many RFCs.

### How to open an RFC

First, hop onto the SoloKeys [public Keybase 
channel](https://keybase.io/team/solokeys.public) and run the idea by
somebody in the [SoloKeys core team]. If there is general agreement that
the idea is worth pursuing, then you can go ahead and open a PR that adds
a new file to the `accepted` directory, starting from [the 
template](template.md). Tag the PR with a subject line like "\[WIP] My
great idea". Opening early helps make the process more
collaborative. We can discuss on the PR itself and ultimately reach
some sort of consensus.

### Decision making process

The intention is for discussion to reach a "general consensus" -- not
necessarily about the *outcome* but about the
*contours of the solution space*. In other words, a general agreement
as to the pros and cons of each alternative, if not necessarily the
relative importance of those pros and cons. Ulimately, decisions
regarding SoloKeys are made by the [SoloKeys core team]. The
reasoning of those decisions will always be laid out in comments on
the RFC itself.
